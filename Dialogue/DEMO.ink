Do you know of anything that may have been used as the weapon, Mrs. Maloney? Something like a very big spanner?

* I can't think of anything. There may be something in the garage.
-> Denying

* Hmm.... Perhaps a leg of meat from the freezer?
-> Revealing

=== Denying ===
I'm sorry I can't be of much help, Seargent Noonan.

=== Revealing ===
Such as the one you put in the oven?

* Yes. The one in the oven, actually.
-> AgreedRes

* I don't see it being very practical, though. Perhaps there's something in the garage.

Mrs. Maloney, I'll have to bring you to the station while we investigate.
