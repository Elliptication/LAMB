Mary: Would you do me a small favor — you and these others?

Police: We can try, Mrs. Maloney.

Mary: Well, here you all are, and good friends of dear Patrick’s too, and helping to catch the man who killed him. You must be terribly hungry by now because it’s long past your suppertime, and I know Patrick would never forgive me, God bless his soul, if I allowed you to remain in his house without offering you decent hospitality. Why don’t you eat up that lamb that’s in the oven. It’ll be cooked just right by now.

Police: Wouldn’t dream of it.

*Please, please eat it. Personally I couldn’t touch a thing, certainly not what’s been in the house when he was here. But it’s all right for you. It’d be a favor to me if you’d eat it up. Then you can go on with your work again afterwards.

*Really sir? It truly won't be of any trouble to me. Continue on with your investigation then.
