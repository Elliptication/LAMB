We usually go out Thursdays, you know, and now he's caught me without any vegetables in the house.","\n","^Sam: Then how about meat, Mrs. Maloney?","\n","^No, I've got meat, thanks. I got a nice leg of lamb from the freezer.","\n","^Sam: Oh.","\n","^I don’t much like cooking it frozen, Sam, but I’m taking a chance on it this time","\n","^You think it’ll be all right?","\n","^Sam: Personally, I don’t believe it makes any difference. You want these Idaho potatoes?","\n","^Oh yes, that’ll be fine. Two of those.","\n","^Sam: Anything else? How about afterwards? What you going to give him for afterwards?","\n","^Well — what would you suggest, Sam?","\n","^Sam: How about a nice big slice of cheesecake? I know he likes that.","\n","^Perfect, He loves it. Thank you, Sam. Goodnight.","\n","^Sam: Goodnight, Mrs. Maloney. And thank you.","\n","^Sam: Very well then. Will it be the usual, peas?","\n","^Um... Sure. Add some potatoes to that as well will you?","\n","^Sam: My pleasure. What is Patrick up to tonight anyway?","\n","^I'm uh.. not totally sure Sam. Anyways, have a nice evening.","\n","^Sam: Oh yes, you as well madam.","\n","^Sam: Oh my, Mrs. Maloney. What a scoundrel he is! In any case, I'm a grocer, and it's not my place to intervene.","\n","^Thank you Sam. May I please have some peas and potatoes for dinner tonight?","\n","^Sam: Certainly, madam! Everything alright Mrs. Maloney? You seem a bit flushed.","\n","^Oh yes! I..I.. I'm fine really. Just a bit flustered from the unfortunate news. Surely you must understand?","\n","^Sam: Of course Mrs. Maloney. Sorry for the intrusion.","\n","^Anyways, I must hurry home now. Bye, Sam.","\n","^Sam: Wait! You forgot your groceries...","\n",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
